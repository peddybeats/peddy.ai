I tend to spend most of my free time by myself. While this is conducive to being extremely productive and self-reflective, it also has the side-effect of alienating me from the rest of society. When I spend significant periods of time thinking about something in isolation (except reviewing literature on the topic), I allow myself to develop priors that are so different than those held by majority of others that communication and exchange of ideas (which I view as the [supreme end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_Stops)) become futile. Therefore, I probably need exposure to other humans and ideologies much more than I actively seek it.

If any of the content on this blog resonates with you, please feel free to reach out to me. Although it may take me a bit of time to get back to you, I will almost always respond to emails that are directed to me and are somewhat well thought out.

I'm a huge proponent of open source software and try to do most of my development work in the open.
